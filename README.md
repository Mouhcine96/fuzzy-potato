# Homelab DevOps Journey

This repository documents my hands-on DevOps learning journey using a personal homelab.

## Goals
- Learn DevOps through real practice, not theory
- Build reproducible infrastructure
- Understand containerization, automation and GitOps principles
- Create a transparent learning and documentation trail

## Environment
- Hardware: ACEMAGICIAN AM06Pro Mini PC
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Focus: Docker, CI/CD, Automation, later Kubernetes

## Philosophy
> Analyse first. Change deliberately. Automate what repeats.
